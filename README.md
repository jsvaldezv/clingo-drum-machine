Smart drum machine with Python and Clingo where you can choose which sound will be the kick, which the snare and which the hihat. Then, the A.I. will make a sound
design, a beat and will give you the best loop based on the centroid, spread and maximun peak. The intelligence is based on Answer Set Programming using Clingo.

### Installation

Note: The mixer was programed and tested in pycharm.
